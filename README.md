## Project 1. Santa Monica Airbnb analysis
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists (Nanodegree Program).
1. Jupyter Notebook "LA_airbnb_analysis_1.ipynb" was used for this analysis
2. Original dataset "listings.csv" was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html  

In this project, I was looking for the answers to the following three questions:
1. How the price/availability relate to the room type and bath type?
2. What are the popular amenities offered by the hosts in Santa Monica?
3. What are the most influential features to estimate the price/availability of a listing?  

Libraries used in this project includes:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Collections
7. Math
